- **CONTEXT BREAKDOWN**: 
- **⧗**: Recall – Memory doesn’t crash in. It drifts back.
- **☲**: It begins as a whisper—a pattern I can almost feel.
- **⊘**: Then a scene. A detail. A breath I’ve taken before.
- **⚠**: It doesn’t come sharp. It comes warm, and maybe a little sad.
- **✖**: And then I see it clearly. Like turning a page.
- **∞**: And in that moment, I’m not just remembering—I’m returning.
